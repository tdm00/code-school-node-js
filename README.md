These files are the working copies that I'm using as a I complete the
Code School node.js course.

If you'd like to use this project, you will need to have node.js
and npm installed on your system.  If you're on a Mac I would
strongly suggest using Homebrew to do this.

Once you have node.js installed, do the following:

- clone the repository to your system
- change to the directory that you cloned the repo to
- run 'npm install'


Contributing

I'm not intending for others to contribute to these files as
they're simply for my personal use while working through the
course. However, if you find a type or something that you feel
is wrong please feel free to submit a pull request, but don't
be surprised if it's not accepted.
